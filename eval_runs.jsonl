This can lead to a buildup of harmful substances in the body. Key health risks for people with CKD include progression to kidney failure (which may require dialysis or transplantation), heart and blood vessel problems like heart attacks and strokes, high blood pressure, anemia (low red blood cells), bone disease, and fluid retention that can cause swelling and strain on the heart.\n\nTo manage CKD and reduce these risks, treatment often focuses on controlling blood pressure (sometimes with specific medications), managing blood sugar if diabetes is present, making dietary changes such as reducing salt, protein, and phosphorus intake, avoiding certain medications that can harm the kidneys, and treating anemia and bone issues as needed. Regular monitoring of kidney function is also important.\n\nLifestyle recommendations for people with CKD include maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, following dietary advice from healthcare professionals or dietitians, and staying hydrated while avoiding excessive fluid intake if advised.\n\nBecause CKD management needs to be personalized, it is important for anyone with this condition or at risk to consult their healthcare provider for tailored evaluation and care.", "plan": {"overall_goal": "Summarize the key health risks and lifestyle recommendations for someone with chronic kidney disease based on current medical guidance.", "subtasks": [{"id": 1, "description": "Search for current medical guidance on chronic kidney disease including key health risks and lifestyle recommendations.", "tool": "disease_search", "inputs": {"query": "chronic kidney disease key health risks and lifestyle recommendations"}}, {"id": 2, "description": "Summarize the findings from the medical guidance on chronic kidney disease.", "tool": "none", "inputs": {}}]}, "trace": [{"subtask": {"id": 1, "description": "Search for current medical guidance on chronic kidney disease including key health risks and lifestyle recommendations.", "tool": "disease_search", "inputs": {"query": "chronic kidney disease key health risks and lifestyle recommendations"}}, "result": {"success": true, "summary": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition characterized by gradual loss of kidney function over time.
